        <h2 class="text-secondary">Hello, I am Maurice Redrick.
            A simple, down to earth lifestyle photographer based in San Antonio, Texas.</h2><br><br>
        <h6 class="text-secondary" style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 35px;">A few years ago I noticed the
            excitement, joy, and happiness<br> that pictures brought people in various situations. They served
            <br>as milestones for significant accomplishments or big moments<br> in life, and I wanted to become
            part of creating that memory to<br> my own clients. I developed a love for photography, and I have<br>
            worked with wedding events, car shows, professional <br>headshots, maternity shoots, and the list goes
            on. I want to<br> create the perfect picture for the perfect moment in everyones<br> life and that's why
            I continue to do this everyday. I would love to<br> work with you and make your special moment a
            lifetime<br> memory!

           <h5 class="text-secondary">How many images can I expect from my session?</h5><br><br>
           <p class="text-secondary">Boudoir Session:(Max 2 Hours; 20 Photos) Starts at $250; 20 Digital Images Only (selected by customer) and price includes location as well.</p><br> </div> 
           <div class="text-secondary" style="line-height: 30px;">Family Portraits: This will depend greatly on the ages of the youngest people involved. A typical family of four, with kids under 5 years old, will usually receive between 25 and 40 finished images.<br>Business Portraits & Headshots: It would generally be safe to expect to see around 15 finished images per hour. <br>Indoor Portraits: Indoor portraits almost always mean bringing my own light sources, which will slow the pace of the session considerably. When shooting portraits indoor, Iâ€™ll usually produce between 10 and 20 finished images in an hour.<br>Specialty Portraits: This includes sport events, parties or celebrations, costume/cosplay, etc. These can range between 40 images to 150 images depending on the event and the customers request.<br><br>
            <h5 class="text-secondary">How will my photos be delivered to me?</h5><br>
            <p class="text-secondary">All pictures will be available through the website and you will be given a password to access and download them for a certain timeframe.</p><br>
            <h5 class="text-secondary">Do you print physical copies of photos?</h5><br>
            <p class="text-secondary">The great news is that after you download your digital copies, you can order a physical copy through any retailer that prints photos. There is also an online store<br> where you can order other novelties.</p><br>
            <h5 class="text-secondary">How long do I wait to recieve the photos?</h5><br>
            <p class="text-secondary">Depending on how many photos need editing and approved by the customer, it can be as little as a few hours, and as long as a couple of days. I do all I can to finish<br>all photos as soon as possible without sacrificing quality!</p><br>
            <h5 class="text-secondary">Do you offer special requests outside your listed services?</h5><br>
            <p class="text-secondary">Short answer, yes! But everything will be evaluated and discussed on a case-by-case basis.</p>
